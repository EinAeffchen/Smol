- **Co-appearance Graph**: Visualize how people in your library are connected.

### ⚡ Powerful Tools
- **Duplicate Detection**: Find and clean up exact or near-duplicates using perceptual hashing.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Docker)

Perfect for NAS or always-on servers.

1.  **Copy the template**:
    ```bash
    cp .env.template .env
    cp omoide.env.example omoide.env
    ```

2.  **Configure `.env`**:
    Set your media directories and ports.
    Ensure the folders you set in your .env actually exist in your system, to prevent permission issues on automatic creation.


3.  **Run**:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

4.  **Open**: `http://localhost:8123`

> **Note for arm64**: Ensure `sqlite-vec` matches your platform (e.g. 0.1.7a2) and build with `docker buildx`.

---

## 🖥️ Quick Start (Desktop Development)

Requirements: Python 3.12+, FFmpeg, Node 18+.

```bash
# 1. Build Frontend
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build && cd ..

# 2. Run Backend
uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8123
```

To build a standalone binary:
```bash
pyinstaller main.spec
```

---

## 🧩 How It Works

- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLModel (SQLite).
- **Vector Search**: `sqlite-vec` for high-performance similarity search.
- **AI Models**:
    - **Vision**: OpenCLIP for embeddings and search.
    - **Faces**: InsightFace (ONNX) for detection and recognition.
    - **Clustering**: HDBSCAN for grouping faces.
- **Frontend**: React + MUI.
